# üî•‚òÅÔ∏è Firebase Functions GitHub Action

- Deploys firebase functions from your GitHub repo

## Setup

Setting up the deployment of Firebase Functions becomes simpler if the deployment of hosting is configured first.
This is because setting up hosting deployment automatically creates a service account in your Firebase project and
gives it permissions to deploy Firebase Hosting. This service account can then be used to deploy Firebase Functions.
(Note that additional permissions are required for deploying Firebase Functions.)

Importantly, it also encrypts that service account's JSON key and uploads it to the specified GitHub repository as a [GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions). This same key can be used when deploying Firebase Functions.

### Setting up hosting

A full setup guide of Firebase Hosting can be found [in the Firebase Hosting docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/github-integration).

The [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) can get you set up quickly with a default configuration.

- If you've NOT set up Hosting, run this version of the command from the root of your local directory:

```bash
firebase init hosting
```

- If you've ALREADY set up Hosting, then you just need to set up the GitHub Action part of Hosting.
  Run this version of the command from the root of your local directory:

```bash
firebase init hosting:github
```

### Setting up functions

A setup guide of Firebase Functions can be found [in the Firebase Functions docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started?gen=2nd).

- If you've NOT set up Functions, run this version of the command from the root of your local directory:

```bash
firebase init functions
```

### Setting up Service Account permissions

Setting up firebase hosting by following the steps outlined above creates a service account with a name similar to the following:
`github-action-123456789@your-firebase-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

You will need to add the role of `Service Account User` (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`) to this service account.
This will allow the service account to properly deploy Cloud Functions.

The permissions can be updated in the **IAM & ADMIN** panel of the Google Cloud console.
`https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=your-firebase-project-id`
If you haven't enabled the **Identity and Access Management (IAM) API**, you may need to do so in order to update roles and allow deployment.


## Usage

### Deploy functions on merge

Add a workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-functions-prod.yml`):

```yaml
name: Deploy Firebase Functions

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy_live_website:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: axel-andersson/action-functions-deploy@v1.0
        with:
          firebaseServiceAccount: "${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}"
          projectId: your-Firebase-project-ID
```

### Deploy functions and hosting on merge

Add a workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-functions-hosting-prod.yml`):

This uses the github action FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy
For information about options and how to use this action, please visit https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy

```yaml
name: Deploy to Live Channel

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    # Optionally configure to run only for specific files. For example:
    # paths:
    # - "website/**"

jobs:
  deploy_live_website:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Add any build steps here. For example:
      # - run: npm ci && npm run build
      - uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0
        with:
          repoToken: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          firebaseServiceAccount: "${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}"
          projectId: your-Firebase-project-ID
          channelId: live
      - uses: axel-andersson/action-functions-deploy@v1.0
      with:
        firebaseServiceAccount: "${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}"
        projectId: your-Firebase-project-ID
```


## Options

### `firebaseServiceAccount` _{string}_ (required)

This is a service account JSON key. The easiest way to set it up is to run `firebase init hosting:github`. However, it can also be [created manually](./docs/service-account.md).

It's important to store this token as an
[encrypted secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)
to prevent unintended access to your Firebase project. Set it in the "Secrets" area
of your repository settings and add it as `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`:
`https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/settings/secrets`.

### `projectId` _{string}_

The Firebase project that contains the Hosting site to which you
want to deploy. If left blank, you need to check in a `.firebaserc`
file so that the Firebase CLI knows which Firebase project to use.

### `entryPoint` _{string}_

The directory containing your [`firebase.json`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#the_firebasejson_file)
file relative to the root of your repository. Defaults to `.` (the root of your repo).

### `firebaseToolsVersion` _{string}_

The version of `firebase-tools` to use. If not specified, defaults to `latest`.
